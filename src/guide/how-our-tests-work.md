# How Our Tests Work

For each test run, you will be informed if your site passed or failed for each issue that we looked for in that specific test suite.

- A “pass” is defined as code DID match the expected pattern/assertion defined in the test.
- A “failure” is defined as code DID NOT match the expected pattern/assertion defined in the test.
