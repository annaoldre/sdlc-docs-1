# About the Testing SDK

AudioEye’s Testing SDK helps engineers test code for accessibility issues early in the development process and reduces the chances for accessibility issues to make it to production.

## Our Approach to Testing

Our testing suite will analyze your site and break down results based on any issues we discover and will also link the related WCAG guideline. When we run a test, we are confirming that the specific results our tests expect is present in your site or code.

Our tests look for success criteria as defined in the WCAG guidelines. When your code passes a test, it doesn’t mean that a WCAG guideline is passed, but that expected behavior we are looking for in that specific test is present on your site.
